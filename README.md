# About Me:
Hey there! My name is Berry. A self taught full stack developer from The Netherlands.

I have been teaching myself web development for about 1.5 years now with The Odin Project as my main curriculum.


# Projects:

Iâ€™m currently working on [Bookmaniac](https://github.com/berryywise/e-bookmaniac). A e-book marketplace made with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and EJS.
You can upload your e-book and publish it with the world. A user management system keeps tracks of all the users and their e-books, and with a marketplace which makes it all come together.

-----------------------------

# Current Path:

At the moment I am learning React to have the full stack MERN toolset under my belt.
