I‚Äôm currently working on [Bookmaniac](https://github.com/berryywise/e-bookmaniac). A e-book marketplace made with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and EJS.
You can upload your e-book and publish it with the world. A user management system keeps tracks of all the users and their e-books, and with a marketplace is where everything comes together.
